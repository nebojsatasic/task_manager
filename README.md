# Task Manager

## Project Overview

This is a secure RESTful API built with Laravel for managing projects and tasks. It provides endpoints for creating, assigning, and tracking projects and tasks, with support for user authentication, project membership, and advanced features like sorting and filtering. Designed with flexibility and maintainability in mind, the API can be easily integrated into other systems to support team collaboration and project organization.

## Features

* Users can register and log in using secure authentication.
* Authenticated users can create new projects.
* Registered users can join existing projects as members.
* Only the creator of a project is allowed to attach or detach members.
* For simplicity, the project creator is automatically added as a member upon creation.
* Both project creators and members can view the project.
* Only the project creator can update or delete a project.
* Authenticated users can view all projects they are members of.
* Project creators and members can add tasks to the project.
* Project creators and members can view all tasks within the project.
* The creator of a task is the only one who can update or delete it.
* The creator of a task is the only one who can assign or unassign a project member to/from that task.
* Users can view a list of tasks they have created.
* Each task shows whether it is finished or open.
* Each task shows the user to whom it is assigned.
* Tasks support sorting and filtering via query parameters.
* Project and task listings are paginated for better performance and usability.
* By default, tasks and members are not included in the project view — they can be included via optional query parameters.
* Authenticated users can view tasks assigned to them.

## Technologies Used

* Laravel 11 – Backend framework for API development
* SQLite – Lightweight relational database used for data storage

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the Laravel API locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nebojsatasic/task-manager.git
cd task-manager/src
```

### 2. Install PHP dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

If you're having issues running the application (especially due to PHP version differences), you may need to update the dependencies:

> ```bash
> composer update
> ```
> ...to re-resolve dependencies for your environment.

### 3. Set up the environment file

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

### 4. Generate the application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Set up the SQLite database

- Create the SQLite database file (this file is not included in version control):
```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```
- Update your `.env` file with the correct database connection:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
```

### 6. Run database migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 7. Start the local development server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Access the API at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## PHP Version Compatibility

This project uses **Laravel 11**, which requires **PHP 8.2 or higher**.

- The app was originally developed with **PHP 8.2** and **Laravel 11**.0
- It has been updated to **Laravel 11.45**, tested and deployed on **PHP 8.4.3**
- **Laravel 11.45** remains compatible with **PHP 8.2**, as long as dependencies do

##### Sorting

By default, tasks are sorted by `created_at` (newest first).

You can override this using the `sort` query parameter. Multiple fields can be combined, separated by commas.

**Allowed sort fields:**
- `title`
- `is_done`
- `created_at`

**Prefix a field with `-` to sort in descending order.**

**Examples:**
- `GET /tasks?sort=title` – Sort by title (ascending)
- `GET /tasks?sort=-created_at` – Sort by creation date (descending)
- `GET /tasks?sort=title,created_at` – Sort by title, then by creation date
- `GET /tasks?sort=-title,-created_at` – Sort by title and creation date (both descending)

##### Filtering

You can filter tasks by their `is_done` status using the `filter[is_done]` query parameter.

**Accepted values:** `true`, `1`, `false`, `0` (as strings)

**Examples:**
- `GET /tasks?filter[is_done]=true` – Returns only **completed** tasks
- `GET /tasks?filter[is_done]=false` – Returns only **incomplete** tasks

**👉 Note:** You can combine filtering and sorting.

Example:  
`GET /tasks?filter[is_done]=true&sort=title`

## Deployment & CI/CD

This project includes a Jenkins pipeline for automated deployment.

### Highlights:

- Pulls from GitHub `main` branch
- Copies .env and SQLite DB from a secure location on the server
- Installs Laravel with `--no-dev` and optimized autoloader
- Sets permissions and ownership for Laravel's writable directories
- Runs `php artisan config:cache` and `route:cache`
- `php artisan view:cache` is commented out — not needed in API-only apps

> See [`Jenkinsfile`](./Jenkinsfile) for details.
